## Step1 : 

You can simply run the "final.pdsprj" file and work with this calculator in proteus.

# Project 2, green thread
In this project we tend to write thread library named green thread which acts like pthread library in c.

# **PreRequirements**

For This Project You Need below Requirements :
- C compiler installed on your device.

## Step2 : Now we have green_test and posix_test, so we can run both files to compare the result
```shell
$ ./green_test
$ ./posix_test
```
